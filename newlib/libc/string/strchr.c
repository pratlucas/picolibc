FUNCTION
	<<strchr>>---search for character in string

INDEX
	strchr

SYNOPSIS
	#include <string.h>
	char * strchr(const char *<[string]>, int <[c]>);

DESCRIPTION
	This function finds the first occurence of <[c]> (converted to
	a char) in the string pointed to by <[string]> (including the
	terminating null character).

RETURNS
	Returns a pointer to the located character, or a null pointer
	if <[c]> does not occur in <[string]>.

PORTABILITY
<<strchr>> is ANSI C.

<<strchr>> requires no supporting OS subroutines.

QUICKREF
	strchr ansi pure
